/**
 * Created by baka kaba on 25/01/2017.
 * 
 * 
 * Central point for managing and viewing announcements.
 * 
 * 
 * This class parses thread pages (sent from [ThreadListRequest])
 * looking for announcements, compares this list to the last set parsed (to determine if any are
 * new), and stores these as the current announcements. Listeners can register for updates when
 * a new announcement is parsed.
 * 
 * 
 * [com.ferg.awfulapp.NavigationEvent.Announcements] displays the current announcements and
 * records the last time * the user viewed them. This is used with [.getUnreadCount] to
 * determine how many of the current announcements were found since the last view.
 * 
 * 
 * I don't really like this system, it feels kind of brittle - if announcements can update (I don't
 * know if they can) without the title changing, the change won't be spotted. And if a title is
 * changed it will look like a new announcement. I don't know if either of these are issues, but
 * that's the drawback. I was going to use the timestamps (which also aren't ideal) but it turns out
 * they randomly jump around timezones when the page is loaded, which is *real nice*
