/**
 * Created by baka kaba on 31/05/2017.
 * 
 * 
 * Handles requests to upload images to the Imgur API, and tracks quotas.
 * 
 * 
 * We handle two kinds of uploads - URLs (basically a link to an image hosted elsewhere), and an
 * actual file upload from the user's device. File uploads take an InputStream, which lets you use
 * the OS's content picker functionality to upload from sources like cloud providers instead of just
 * local files. The response JSON is returned, see the API docs for what this contains.
 * 
 * 
 * Imgur operates a credit system, so we need to keep track of the user and app limits and prevent
 * uploads when they're hit. Unfortunately we can't request this information (without spending credits)
 * so we need to store the latest data from the last response, and expire that when it becomes stale.
 * This isn't perfect (e.g. the credits for the entire app will probably have changed no matter what)
 * but it's a compromise we need to make.
 * 
 * 
 * Imgur doesn't allow many credits on the free tier - currently 12,500, enough for 1,250 upload attempts.
 * There's rate limiting for each user, but it's 500 credits per hour, so the daily app limit is only 25x
 * that. The user limit is implemented (in case it changes and starts to affect things), but we also have
 * our own daily user quota which will cut people off way earlier. This is to make sure a handful of users
 * can't spend all the app credits - the actual limit will probably need tweaking.
 * 
 * 
 * Also hitting the app credit limit too many times in a month will get us kicked off for the rest
 * of the month, so there's a buffer setting which effectively lowers the credit limit to block uploads
 * early. Unfortunately this only works when we know the current app credits, and if we don't have that
 * data (because we haven't uploaded in the current period) then we have to blindly attempt the upload
 * and hope we have credits. If the buffer isn't big enough and we end up with too many blind requests
 * pushing us over the limit, then this will need to be changed - maybe by making a simple GET to get
 * the current value when we don't have data. Slightly complicates things, but it might need to be done.
 * 
 * 
 * The [.getCurrentUploadLimit] method attempts to provide the currently applicable limit
 * (i.e. the lowest one) and the time when that limit will reset. Because there are multiple limits
 * (some not directly affected by the user) this could be a bit confusing, with allowed uploads
 * decreasing between uses (if the app limit is close to being hit), 'resets' giving inconsistent
 * numbers (if another limit is now lower and taking precedence), etc. It might actually be better
 * to not give the user any indication of how many uploads they can perform if it's too wild, but
 * I think it's good to at least have an idea of what's going on, especially if you want to write a
 * post and have a few things to include.

        * Get the best estimate of the remaining number of uploads the user can perform, and when that limit resets.
        *
        *
        * Imgur sets limits on the number of basic API requests and actual uploads each app and user
        * can do. In addition, this app also limits user uploads to ration the overall app limit, and
        * prevent individual users from overdoing it at the expense of others. This method provides
        * the best guess at how many full uploads the user **can** perform, and a timestamp of when
        * that limit will be reset.
        *
        *
        * Because API requests cost credits, we don't actually ask the server how many credits
        * are remaining for the app and the user - upload responses provide this info, and we store that
        * when the user attempts an upload. If we don't have current data for these limits (e.g. the
        * most recent data is stale) then we can't draw any meaningful conclusions about the current
        * situation - in this case the method returns **null** for the count and timestamp.
        *
        *
        * If we have this data , then we return the lowest limit in place, along with the timestamp for
        * when we expect this limit to change (which may be null if we can't estimate that, e.g. the app
        * credit limit resets at an unknown time, but apparently within a day). This is complicated by
        * the fact that another limit might drop below this one - say if other users drain all the app
        * credits - and cause a new reset time to apply, or the reset might happen (e.g. your personal
        * quota is restored) but now another limit is lower (the total app limit), so the reset doesn't
        * seem to have applied properly.
        *
        *
        * Basically this is complicated with multiple restrictions in place, some happening at a distance
        * and affected by other users, and we're having to walk around in the dark trying not to touch
        * the API too much. So use this in an advisory capacity only!
        *
        * @ return an upload count / reset timestamp pair, both potentially null if we don't have that data
